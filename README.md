# Noise Modeler

An in-game procedural terrain and content generation framework.

![screenshot](http://www.noisemodeler.org/images/noisemodelerfullscreenshot.png)

Noise Modeler is a tool for designing noise-based functions through a flow-graph interface. The GUI application specializes in designing noise-based procedural heightmap terrains, but can be used to model other content as well, such as terrain for 2D games. A high-resolution real-time preview of the terrain is updated instantly as the terrain is edited.

Generated terrain models can be stored as procedural models consuming only a few kB of storage. Through the nmlib library library, models can be expanded by a game engine during run-time.

## Documentation

There are several places to find documentation about Noise Modeler:

 * [Project web site](http://www.noisemodeler.org)
 * [The Noise Modeler Library documentation](http://docs.noisemodeler.org)
 * [The Noise Modeler user's guide](http://www.noisemodeler.org/usersguide/noisemodeler-usersguide-0.1.5.pdf)
 * [Master's thesis about Noise Modeler](https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/2352231?show=full)
 * This readme (contains brief build instructions and project overview)
 * Commented example usage of the library may also be found in the `test_nmlib` and `nmcli` directories.

## Folder structure

 * `nmlib` a C++ library, which allows creation, editing and evaluation of flow-graphs. Used by `nmgui`.
 * `nmgui` a graphical flow-graph editor and terrain previewer.
 * `nmcli` a command line tool to generate GLSL functions from `nm.json` files.
 * `test_nmlib` unit tests for `nmlib`.
 * `test_nmgui` unit tests for `nmgui`.
 * `dependencies` header-only dependencies as git submodules.

## Dependencies

### nmlib

 * boost::signals2
 * c++11 (tested with gcc 4.8)
 * rapidjson (included as git submodule)

### nmgui

 * nmlib
 * boost::signals2
 * Qt 5.2+
   * qtquick
   * qtquick-controls
   * svg
 * c++11 (tested with gcc 4.8)

### Unit tests

 * googletest (only required for unit tests)

## Build instructions

This is a brief guide for experienced developers. In-depth build instructions from Windows, Ubuntu 14.04+ and Arch Linux can be found in the user's guide.

First, make sure you have all of the following dependencies installed:

 * Qt 5.2+ (including base, declarative, qtquick-controls and svg modules)
 * Boost
 * gcc with C++11 support
 * googletest (if building unit tests)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository.
git clone --recursive git@github.com:noisemodeler/noisemodeler.git 

# 2. Create a build directory
mkdir build-noisemodeler
cd build-noisemodeler

# 3. Build
qmake ../noisemodeler
make

# 4a. Run
nmgui/nmgui

# 4b. Install and run (unix only, this will install noisemodeler in /usr/)
sudo make install
nmgui
```
